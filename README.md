# Ages of Art
## Zoe Weinstein

## About
Ages of art is a game modeled off of https://wikitrivia.tomjwatson.com/. However it has been changed to generate a randomly assorted set amount of paintings which the user must drag into the correct chronilogical order. This is a capstone project for the epicodus bootcamp.

## Bugs and Issues
Currently random numbers are being used as a placeholder for the paintings. There have been issues using dnd-kit to make the draggable items arranged horizontally.

## Future plans
In addition to adding the actual paintings, I would like to add a field for the user to select an era/region of art or an artist.

## Technologies used
HTML
CSS
React/JSX
Javascript
@dnd-kit
The Met API
Fetch api


This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
